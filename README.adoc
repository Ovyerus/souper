= Soup

Inspired by the python library BeautifulSoup, this is a layer on top of html5ever that adds a different API for querying & manipulating HTML

== Installation

In order to use, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

----
[dependencies]
soup = "0.1"
----

== Usage

`soup` requires Rust 2018, so make sure you have `edition = 2018` in your `Cargo.toml`. Then, you just have to `use` it:

----
// src/main.rs

use reqwest;
use soup::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let html = reqwest::get("https://google.com").unwrap();
    let soup = Soup::new(html);
    let some_text = soup.find()
    			.tag("p")
			.attr("class", "hidden")
			.execute()
			.unwrap()
			.text()
			.unwrap();
}
